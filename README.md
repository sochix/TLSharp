## Quick Configuration
Telegram API isn't that easy to start. You need to do some configuration first.

1. Create a [developer account](https://my.telegram.org/) in Telegram. 
1. Goto [API development tools](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and copy **API_ID** and **API_HASH** from your account. You'll need it later.
